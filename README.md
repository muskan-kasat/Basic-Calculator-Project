# Basic-Calculator-Project
### **Project Description**

The Basic Calculator project is a web-based application designed to simulate the functionality of a physical calculator. It allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division through an interactive and intuitive user interface. This project aims to enhance the understanding of front-end web development concepts by combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### **Key Features**
1. **User Interface:**
   - A clean and user-friendly interface that includes:
     - A display screen for showing inputs and results.
     - Buttons for digits (0â€“9), operators (+, -, *, /), decimal points, and special functions like Clear and Equals.

2. **Core Functionality:**
   - Users can input numbers and operators either via on-screen buttons or keyboard input.
   - Perform accurate arithmetic calculations with adherence to the correct order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS).
   - Display results dynamically as operations are performed.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Prevent invalid inputs such as multiple consecutive operators or decimals.
   - Handle division by zero gracefully, displaying an appropriate error message.

4. **Interactive Design:**
   - Buttons are visually styled for ease of interaction.
   - Provides visual feedback, such as button hover effects, to enhance usability.

5. **Responsiveness:**
   - The calculator is responsive and works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

### **Technologies Used**
1. **HTML:**  
   - Provides the structural layout of the calculator, including the display area and buttons.
   
2. **CSS:**  
   - Used for styling the calculator, creating an aesthetically pleasing layout with color schemes, button designs, and responsive adjustments.

3. **JavaScript:**  
   - Implements the interactive and functional aspects of the calculator, such as handling button clicks, performing calculations, and updating the display dynamically.

### **Learning Outcomes**
- **Understand the integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** to create interactive and functional web applications.  
- Learn how to manage and manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) to update the UI dynamically based on user interactions.  
- Enhance knowledge of arithmetic operations and the implementation of the correct order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS) in programming.  
- Practice responsive web design techniques to ensure a seamless user experience across various devices.

### **Scope of the Project**
This project focuses on building a foundational understanding of web development by creating a fully functional calculator with basic features. It can be further expanded or customized with additional functionalities such as:
- Memory buttons (MC, MR, M+, M-).
- Advanced operations (square root, percentage, power, etc.).
- Theme switching (light and dark modes).
- History log to track previous calculations.

The skills and concepts learned from this project can serve as a stepping stone for more complex projects, such as developing dynamic web applications or integrating back-end functionalities in the future.

By completing this project, you will not only create a practical and engaging tool but also strengthen your expertise in web development, preparing you for more advanced challenges in software development.
